        - Optical phase control of laser field at the ion.
        - Fastgates on multi ion chain.

    * Immediate tasks: Finishing vacuum work, trap on table. Trapping ions 

    * Proposed first experiments?

Abstract

Introduction
Previously the physicist was limited to thought experiments on the
nature of highly coherent quantum effects. It was even thought to be
inconceivable for single atoms to be probed and entangled. However the
advent of Ion traps, specifically Paul and Penning traps, have enabled
the experimental exploration of Atomic and Laser physics and some of
the most precise measurements of physical constants.  Decoherence may
be seen as measurement of a state by the environment. Ion traps allow
the decoupling of single ions to the surrounding environment and
thus...
With the high degree of experimental control Ion trap systems coupled
with low linewidth lasers provides, trapped ions are a popular
platform for enabling Quantum Computation.

Experimental Details

Description of Blade and limitations
Proof of principle experiments have been completed on Blade, a blade-style ion trap. Blade has a few limitations for the exploration of fast gates by the above described Cnulled method, motivating the design of a new system.
Blade has dual optical access of the ions however, only as 45 degrees to the chain axial direction. Only global laser addressing of the chain is possible limiting the intensity seen at the ion. The simpler blade style trap, has limited control over creation of electric potentials meaning shuttling of ions is not practical.

Here we describe the design of the new ``FastGates'' system which is
tailored for the exploration of fast, non-adiabatic entangling
gates. Figure X shows a schematic of the vacuum can of ``FastGates''
with the addressing directions and magnetic field highlighted. Ca40 was chosen for
initial experiments due to its simple energy level structure, figure
X, without hyperfine levels and with the option for a quadrupole qubit
between the S and D levels. An external magnetic field of 5G is applied to define our Zeeman sublevels, this low field will not allow state selective addressing by frequency, however allows for polarization selective addressing. *** Check if 729 will actually have linewidth for frequency addressing? ***
The isotope having 0 nuclear spin and
hence no hyperfine levels greatly simplifies control schemes however
precludes the option of using magnetically insensitive ``clock''
qubits. To ensure we do not greatly limit coherence time of our
quadrupole transition we use a MuMetal enclosure to suppress stray environmental magnetic fields.
