%Introduction {{{
Introduction
Previously the physicist was limited to thought experiments on the
nature of highly coherent quantum effects. It was even thought to be
inconceivable for single atoms to be probed and entangled. However the
advent of Ion traps, specifically Paul and Penning traps, have enabled
the experimental exploration of Atomic and Laser physics and some of
the most precise measurements of physical constants.  Decoherence may
be seen as measurement of a state by the environment. Ion traps allow
the decoupling of single ions to the surrounding environment and
thus...
With the high degree of experimental control Ion trap systems coupled
with low linewidth lasers provides, trapped ions are a popular
platform for enabling Quantum Computation.

\subtitle{Ion Trapping Apparatus}


The technical complexity of ion trapping experiments may be reduced to
solving two problems: Controlling the state of the ion (both internal
and motional); and controlling the environment the ion is within.
Our Ion trap experiments consist of: an atomic source, a trap, a
vacuum system encasing these, external magnetic field coils, and
lasers for ionization, cooling, repumping, stateprep, coherent
control and readout.
As with all ventures in experimental physics, as technologies mature, so
too do the capabilities and scope of our apparatus.  Here we shall
describe the ``Old'' apparatus, known in short as ``Blade'', where
proof of principle fast gate schemes have been tested. The limitations
of ``Blade'' for further fast gate work will be made apparant and
the new proposed system, known as ``FastGates'', will be described. 

\subtitle{Ion and Trap}

As mentioned, the overall system we desire is a spin coupled to a spring. Our spin in this case being a Hydrogen-like ion, and the spring being the harmonic motion of the ions within the trapping potential. FigureX shows a schematic of a linear Paul trap, which we use to create the harmonic trapping potential required. There are various methods of realizing a paul trap, here we describe: A macro 3D Blade trap; a surface trap; and a microfabricated multilayer trap. 
The ``Blade'' apparatus is named such due to its use of the Blade style trap, which can be seen in FigureX. The 

Assuming our trapping potential to be quadratic, we have a spin system coupled to a spring. The Jaynes Cummings Hamiltonian,
$$ H = H_{spin} + H_{HO} + H_{Int}, $$
summarises this coupled system.

In a reductionist viewpoint, 
Description of Blade and limitations Proof of principle experiments
have been completed on Blade, a blade-style ion trap. Blade has a few
limitations for the exploration of fast gates by the above described
Cnulled method, motivating the design of a new system.  Blade has dual
optical access of the ions however, only as 45 degrees to the chain
axial direction. Only global laser addressing of the chain is possible
limiting the intensity seen at the ion. The simpler blade style trap,
has limited control over creation of electric potentials meaning
shuttling of ions is not practical.


\subtitle{FastGates Apparatus}

Here we describe the design of the new ``FastGates'' system which is
tailored for the exploration of fast, non-adiabatic entangling
gates. Figure X shows a schematic of the vacuum can of ``FastGates''
with the addressing directions and magnetic field highlighted. Ca40
was chosen for initial experiments due to its simple energy level
structure, figure X, without hyperfine levels and with the option for
a quadrupole qubit between the S and D levels. An external magnetic
field of 5G is applied to define our Zeeman sublevels, this low field
will not allow state selective addressing by frequency, however allows
for polarization selective addressing. *** Check if 729 will actually
have linewidth for frequency addressing? *** The isotope having 0
nuclear spin and hence no hyperfine levels greatly simplifies control
schemes however precludes the option of using magnetically insensitive
``clock'' qubits. To ensure we do not greatly limit coherence time of
our quadrupole transition we use a MuMetal enclosure to suppress stray
environmental magnetic fields.
