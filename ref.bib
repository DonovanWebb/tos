	abstract = {Methods of finding good quantum error-correcting codes are discussed, and many example codes are presented. The recipe C-2(perpendicular to) subset of or equal to C-1, where C-1 and C-2 are classical codes, is used to obtain codes for up to 16 information quantum bits (qubits) with correction of small numbers of errors. The results are tabulated. More efficient codes are obtained by allowing C-1 to have reduced distance, and introducing sign changes among the code words in a systematic manner. This systematic approach leads to single-error-correcting codes for 3, 4, and 5 information qubits with block lengths of 8, 10, and 11 qubits, respectively.},

A natural link is then revealed between basic quantum theory and the linear error correcting codes of classical information theory. A subset of the known codes is described, having properties which are important for error correction in quantum communication. It is shown that a pair of states which are, in a certain sense ''macroscopically different,'' can form a superposition in which the interference phase between the two parts is measurable. This provides a highly stabilized ''Schrodinger cat'' state.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) networks are studied by a combination of numerical and approximate analytical treatments. The probability of failure of the recovery I operation is calculated for a variety of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and more noise tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries that can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various parameters. The main parameters are the gate gamma and memory epsilon failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t(m) required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on the [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise gamma(0) is a function of epsilon/gamma and t(m); example values are \{epsilon/gamma,t(m), gamma(0)\} = \{1,1,10(-3)\}, \{0.01,1,3 x 10(-3)\}, \{1,100,10(-4)\}, \{0.01,100,2 x 10(-3)\}, assuming zero cost for. information transport. This represents an order of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise, compared with previous calculations, which is made possible by recent insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process.},

These advances result from the successful work of generations of scientists who have made use of quantum physics, spending only a small fraction of their time puzzling at its wonders and directing their efforts to apply it at explaining Nature. It then considers the elaboration of the theory, the long process during which the strange and counter-intuitive manifestations of the quantum have emerged. It is during this process — mainly in the 1920s — that thought experiments were conceived. The chapter recalls their main features and describes, on a few examples, how they are now realized in the laboratory by exploiting modern technology. These experiments can be quite generally viewed as manipulations of quantum oscillators and two-level spin-like particles in mutual interaction. An overview of the subsequent chapters is presented.},

The full QED Hamiltonian consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term Hem, the pure matter term Hmatt and the interaction term Hint. The Hem-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, Hem cannot generate any forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that Hem attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and to the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by Hint.},

	abstract = {Friction between ordered, atomically smooth surfaces at the nanoscale (nanofriction) is often governed by stick-slip processes. To test long-standing atomistic models of such processes, we implemented a synthetic nanofriction interface between a laser-cooled Coulomb crystal of individually addressable ions as the moving object and a periodic light-field potential as the substrate. We show that stick-slip friction can be tuned from maximal to nearly frictionless via arrangement of the ions relative to the substrate. By varying the ion number, we also show that this strong dependence of friction on the structural mismatch, as predicted by many-particle models, already emerges at the level of two or three atoms. This model system enables a microscopic and systematic investigation of friction, potentially even into the quantum many-body regime.},

Special emphasis is placed on effects that arise from the interplay between internal (electronic) and vibrational (center-of-mass) degrees of freedom of an atom. In order to provide a fully quantum mechanical understanding of the excitation, we used the density-matrix approach based on the Liouville–von Neumann equation. The developed theory has been applied to the particular case of the 4s2S1/2→3d2D5/2 electric quadrupole (E2) transition in a 40Ca+ ion induced by Laguerre-Gaussian modes. It was found that the Rabi oscillations can show unconventional anharmonic behavior that is attributed to the strong coupling between vibrational levels of the trap. This effect is accompanied by the transfer of angular momentum to the center-of-mass motion and becomes most pronounced when the Rabi frequency is comparable to the trapping frequency.},

	abstract = {Universal control of multiple qubits—the ability to entangle qubits and to perform arbitrary individual qubit operations1—is a fundamental resource for quantum computing2, simulation3 and networking4. Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations5–7 and single-qubit rotations8 so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams9–12 or by moving ions with respect to laser beams13–15, but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods16–20 may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of \$\$\{1\}\_\{-0.0017\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0\}\$\$and \$\$\{0.9977\}\_\{-0.0013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0010\}\$\$, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics21,22 and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout23,24 provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00340-018-7011-0},
	abstract = {We present an experimental technique to determine the degenerate two-photon absorption (2PA) spectra by performing a single Z-scan using a high-spectral-irradiance white light continuum (WLC) generated by a hollow core fiber. The hollow fiber was filled with Argon (Ar) gas at a pressure of 0.6 bar and was pumped with 500 mJ, 30 fs, and 800 nm pulses. The broadband WLC pulses with 350 nm bandwidth in the range of 600–950 nm were compressed to sub-8 fs pulses. To characterize and interpret the data obtained from this method, the spectral, temporal and spatial characteristics of the WLC were first analyzed. The WLC emerging from the compressor was dispersed using a prism pair and then focused into the sample by a cylindrical lens. Since different spectral components are spatially separated, any part of the sample in the beam cross section is irradiated with almost single wavelength pulses leading to only a degenerate 2PA process. The nonlinear transmittance was then measured by a charge-coupled-device (CCD) line camera as a function of the sample position while the sample was moved along the beam direction by a motorized translation stage. In this way the Z-scans at different wavelengths in the WLC spectral range can be measured and thus the wavelength-resolved degenerate 2PA spectra can be obtained by performing a single scan using dispersive WLC. This method was verified on a well-characterized dye Rhodamine B and yield a reasonable agreement with the data found in the literature. We used this method to determine the 2PA spectra of some two-photon initiators (2PIs) developed for two-photon polymerization (2PP) based 3D micro-structuring.},

This scheme was specifically designed for application with multiphoton imaging, particularly of neurons, where it will enable the concurrent monitoring of physiological signals at multiple locations within a microscopic 3-D volume (350×350×200 µm). When used for this purpose, we demonstrate how this scheme would also inherently compensate for spatial dispersion when ultrafast laser pulses are used in acousto-optic multiphoton microscopy.},

We use a recently proposed method to find the modes that diagonalize the linearized time-dependent dynamical problem. This allows one to obtain explicitly the (‘Floquet–Lyapunov’) transformation to coordinates of decoupled linear oscillators. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analyzing the modes of a small ‘peculiar’ crystal in a linear Paul trap. The calculations can be readily generalized to multispecies ion crystals in general multipole traps, and time-dependent quantum wavefunctions of ion oscillations in such traps can be obtained.},

The choice of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer (1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared to the gate array model, especially issues of parallelisability of algorithms.},

We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization.

The AOD is designed as a beam scanner to address two-photon transitions in a two-dimensional array of trapped neutral Rb87 atoms in a quantum computer. Momentum space is used to design AODs that have the same diffraction angles for two wavelengths (780 and 480 nm) and have nonoverlapping Bragg-matched frequency response at these wavelengths, so that there will be no cross talk when proportional frequencies are applied to diffract the two wavelengths. The appropriate crystal orientation, crystal shape, transducer size, and transducer height are determined for an AOD made with a tellurium dioxide crystal (TeO2). The designed and fabricated AOD has more than 100 resolvable spots, widely separated band shapes for the two wavelengths within an overall octave bandwidth, spatially overlapping diffraction angles for both wavelengths (780 and 480 nm), and a 4 μs or less access time. Cascaded AODs in which the first device upshifts and the second downshifts allow Doppler-free scanning as required for addressing the narrow atomic resonance without detuning. We experimentally show the diffraction-limited Doppler-free scanning performance and spatial resolution of the designed AOD.},

	abstract = {The ability to individually and agilely manipulate qubits is crucial for the scalable trapped-ion quantum information processing. A plethora of challenging proposals have been demonstrated with the utilization of optical addressing systems, in which single ions is addressed exclusively by individual laser beam. However, crosstalk error in optical addressing systems limits the gate fidelity, becoming an obstacle to quantum computing, especially quantum error correction. In this work, we demonstrate a low-crosstalk double-side addressing system based on a pair of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). The AODs addressing method can flexibly and parallelly address arbitrary ions between which the distance is variable in a chain. We employ two 0.4{\textasciitilde}NA objective lenses in both arms of the Raman laser and obtain a beam waist of 0.95{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$, resulting in a Rabi rate crosstalk as low as \$6.32{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ when the neighboring ion separation is about 5.5{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$. This agile and low-crosstalk double-side addressing system is promising for higher-fidelity gates and the practical application of the quantum error correction.},

In the case of an ion trap quantum computer these gates are implemented by shining laser beams onto the ions in a controlled way. This thesis deals with the development and implementation of a novel setup for single ion addressing, which enables simultaneous and individual manipulation of the ions. The new setup makes use of ﬁbre beamsplitters for multiplexing the addressing laser and ﬁbre AOMs for altering each beam individually. A micro-mirror array is utilised to point each beam to a single ion. The optics needed to focus the beams onto individual ions is simulated and investigated in a test setup. The most promising of the simulated setups, which is expected to be able to address up to four ions, is implemented into the experiment. The waist of the central addressing beam in this setup is measured to be w0 = 1.52(5) µm. For future experiments, simulations with another objective with NA {\textasciitilde} 0.8 are performed, which indicate addressability of up to 19 ions.},

At the point of maximum gradient of the standing wave, blue detuned cooling is found that is analogous to the Sisyphus cooling of free atoms.

Under the assumption that the rate for optical pumping between the atomic ground states defines the smallest time constant in the system, analytic expressions for the final energy and the cooling rates are derived, with both a semiclassical and a full quantum treatment. The results show that laser cooling of a trapped ion using polarization gradients leads to very low energies.

Yet, the most common methods for sideband cooling implicitly rely on low Doppler-cooled temperatures and tightly confined ions, and they cannot be optimized for different experimental conditions. Here we introduce a framework which calculates the fastest possible pulsed sideband cooling sequence for a given number of pulses and set of experimental parameters, and we verify its improvement compared to traditional methods using a trapped \${\textasciicircum}\{171\}\$Yb\${\textasciicircum}+\$ ion. After extensive cooling, we find that the ion motional distribution is distinctly non-thermal and thus not amenable to standard thermometry techniques. We therefore develop and experimentally validate an improved method to measure ion temperatures after sideband cooling. These techniques will enable more efficient cooling and thermometry within trapped-ion systems, especially those with high initial temperatures or spatially-extended ion wavepackets.},

	abstract = {The coherent control of quantum-entangled states of trapped ions1 has led to significant advances in quantum information2, quantum simulation3, quantum metrology4,5 and laboratory tests of quantum mechanics6 and relativity7. All of the basic requirements for processing quantum information with arrays of ion-based quantum bits (qubits) have been proven in principle8. However, so far, no more than 14 ion-based qubits have been entangled with the ion-trap approach9, so there is a clear need for arrays of ion traps that can handle a much larger number of qubits10. Traps consisting of a two-dimensional electrode array11 have undergone significant development, but three-dimensional trap geometries can create a superior confining potential. However, existing three-dimensional approaches, as used in the most advanced experiments with trap arrays8,12, cannot be scaled up to handle greatly increased numbers of ions. Here, we report a monolithic three-dimensional ion microtrap array etched from a silica-on-silicon wafer using conventional semiconductor fabrication technology. We have confined individual 88Sr+ ions and strings of up to 14 ions in a single segment of the array. We have measured motional frequencies, ion heating rates and storage times. Our results demonstrate that it should be possible to handle several tens of ion-based qubits with this approach.},

The approach uses conventional components, materials and techniques in a unique fashion. The microtrap chip is mounted on a modified ceramic leadless chip carrier, the conductors of which serve as the vacuum feedthrough. The chip carrier is indium-sealed to stainless-steel components to form vacuum seals, resulting in short electrical path lengths of ≤20 mm from the trap electrodes under vacuum to air side. The feedthrough contains conductors for the radio-frequency trap drive, as well as 42 conductors for DC electrodes. Vacuum pressures of ∼1 × 10−11 mbar are achieved, and ions have been confined and laser cooled in a microtrap chip. The apparatus enables accurate measurements of radio-frequency voltage amplitudes on the trap electrodes, yielding an excellent agreement between measured and modelled trap efficiencies. This feature is of significant use in establishing initial operation of new devices. The principle of the connectivity scheme presented here is applicable to larger ceramic chip carriers containing many more conductors.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Trapped ions are a promising platform for experimental quantum computing, possessing the longest decoherence times and the highest fidelity logic gates of any candidate technology. The challenge remains to scale up ion-trap systems to larger numbers of qubits. This thesis benchmarks two fundamental operations for scalable trapped-ion quantum computing: the memory performance of a $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ hyperfine qubit, and mixed-element entangling gates between $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ and $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Decoherence is usually measured over long timescales, where the memory errors ε are large compared to state-preparation and measurement errors. Information about the small-error regime relevant for quantum computing is inferred by extrapolation. In this work we use randomised benchmarking to directly measure errors as small as 1.2(7) × 10$^{\textrm{−6}}$ after a storage time of 1 ms, which is around an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected based on the usual model of exponential decay. We find ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$ for up to 50 ms with no additional dynamical decoupling, and ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−3}}$ for up to 2 seconds using a simple CPMG sequence. These timescales exceed previously-demonstrated gate or measurement times in trapped-ion systems by several orders of magnitude — a requirement for quantum error correction, and a highly desirable feature for near-term processors. The qubit is robust to offsets of the external magnetic-field strength, with ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{-4}}$ for 1 ms even at a 50 mG offset, and we identify phase noise on the reference oscillator as the limiting factor on the memory performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We provide a comparison of different implementations of mixed-element geometric phase gates in the same experimental system. This includes a light-shift gate which can be implemented on both ion species using a single laser, with a fidelity of 99.8(1)\% or 99.7(1)\%, measured using partial state tomography or interleaved randomised benchmarking respectively. We also demonstrate several Mølmer–Sørensen gates with measured fidelities of up to 99.6(2)\% (by partial state tomography); this mechanism is more susceptible to errors arising from instability of the external magnetic field. For the first time, this pushes mixed-element entangling gate fidelities over the fault-tolerant threshold level (above which error correction is possible), and puts them on par with state-of-the-art single-species gates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on σz ⊗ σz and σφ ⊗ σφ interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser ﬁeld can be realized by an amplitudemodulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.},

Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations5–7 and single-qubit rotations8 so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams9–12 or by moving ions with respect to laser beams13–15, but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods16–20 may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of \$\$\{1\}\_\{-0.0017\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0\}\$\$and \$\$\{0.9977\}\_\{-0.0013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0010\}\$\$, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics21,22 and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout23,24 provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Optical atomic clocks are our most precise tools to measure time and frequency1–3. Precision frequency comparisons between clocks in separate locations enable one to probe the space–time variation of fundamental constants4,5 and the properties of dark matter6,7, to perform geodesy8–10 and to evaluate systematic clock shifts. Measurements on independent systems are limited by the standard quantum limit; measurements on entangled systems can surpass the standard quantum limit to reach the ultimate precision allowed by quantum theory—the Heisenberg limit. Although local entangling operations have demonstrated this enhancement at microscopic distances11–16, comparisons between remote atomic clocks require the rapid generation of high-fidelity entanglement between systems that have no intrinsic interactions. Here we report the use of a photonic link17,18 to entangle two 88Sr+ ions separated by a macroscopic distance19 (approximately 2 m) to demonstrate an elementary quantum network of entangled optical clocks. For frequency comparisons between the ions, we find that entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by nearly \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{2\}\$\$, the value predicted for the Heisenberg limit. Today’s optical clocks are typically limited by dephasing of the probe laser20; in this regime, we find that entanglement yields a factor of 2 reduction in the measurement uncertainty compared with conventional correlation spectroscopy techniques20–22. We demonstrate this enhancement for the measurement of a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. This two-node network could be extended to additional nodes23, to other species of trapped particles or—through local operations—to larger entangled systems.},

Trapped ions make an excellent physical platform for such a quantum computer, as they have demonstrated unparalleled qubit operation fidelities and memory times, but significant challenges remain in scaling up these systems. A promising scalable architecture is a photonically connected network of mixed element trapped ion nodes, each containing a few ions of two species. Poor quality remote entanglement links between nodes can be tolerated, if entanglement between ions in the same node can be achieved with high fidelity. While local gates have been repeatedly demonstrated between ions of the same species, the fidelity of mixed element quantum gates have not previously surpassed the fault tolerant threshold, above which errors can in principle be corrected.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this thesis we demonstrate an entangling operation between $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$, useful for its long lived qubits, and $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$, well suited for remote entanglement, using a novel mechanism requiring only one laser to manipulate both species. This relatively simple scheme, which is independent of either qubit frequency, allows us to achieve Bell state fidelities of F = 99.8(1)\%. We assess the operation of the gate further with state and process tomography, which achieve Bell state fidelity F = 98.1\% and average gate fidelity F̅ = 99.05(6)\% respectively, though they are hampered by experimental drifts during the long data collection. Finally, we use interleaved randomised benchmarking to get the best estimate of our gate errors, finding an average gate fidelity of F̅ = 99.62(3)\% for a sequence of 60 interleaved gates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Along with a demonstration of entanglement between two $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$ ions, achieved with fidelity F = 95.9(4)\%, this work paves the way towards demonstrating an elementary mixed species quantum network in future experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized π/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.},

Therefore, recent efforts have been concentrated on using quantum communication to link a number of small ion-trap quantum systems. Developing the array-based approach, we show how to achieve massively parallel gate operation in a large-scale quantum computer, based on techniques already demonstrated for manipulating small quantum registers. The use of decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence during ion transport, and removes the requirement of clock synchronization between the interaction regions.},

We make a design study of how best to integrate an ion trap with the microwave conductors required to implement the gate and propose a novel integrated resonant structure. The trap was fabricated and ions were successfully loaded. Single-qubit experiments show that the microwave fields above the trap are in excellent agreement with software simulations.

The apparatus involves many design improvements over a previous quantum processing experiment which achieved the highest single-qubit gate fidelity, longest coherence time, and highest microwave based two-qubit fidelity. The goal of this new experiment is a two-qubit gate speed and a fidelity improvement of a factor of 10, making microwave based gates much more feasible as quantum processors. To this end, a novel clock qubit within $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ is chosen, and the ion height is nearly halved. An anticipated heating rate increase is counteracted by the use of cryogenics. A novel ion chip design is implemented via wafer-scale fabrication and subsequently attached using a novel eutectic bonding technique. The implementation required many design and fabrication problems to be solved; these are described. The vacuum system reaches {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−11}}$ mbar even at room temperature, lowering experimental difficulty and allowing for performance comparisons at a wide temperature range. A new experiment control system, ARTIQ, and corresponding Sinara hardware is used for control. Experimental results achieved so far include a study of contributing factors to the ion loading rate, and a comparison between the designed and measured microwave fields. All results achieved to date are compatible with the main speed and fidelity goal, which should be achieved in the near future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is shown that laser gain is proportional to the imaginary part of the linear susceptibility, which is obtained from the semiclassical treatment. The second viewpoint uses a slightly modified form of Einstein’s A and B coefficients adapted to describing interactions between atoms and monochromatic fields. Various damping and broadening mechanisms are introduced in a reasonable but non-rigorous fashion, and the crucial distinction between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening is introduced.},
